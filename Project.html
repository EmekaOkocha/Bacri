                <h2>OUR FLAGSHIP PROJECT: "Know Your Rights"</h2>
                [cite_start]<p>Our flagship project, "Know Your Rights," has already reached **350 children in Plateau State**[cite: 20]. [cite_start]We are closing the lines created by the ethnic and religious bias resulting from the recurring incidences of ethnic and religious violence[cite: 21].</p>
                
                <h3>Addressing Violence and Ignorance</h3>
                [cite_start]<p>Violence continues because children are often used as instruments due to their ignorance and vulnerability, leading to an endless cycle of violence[cite: 21]. [cite_start]With the "Know Your Rights" project, we have been able to address this challenge by enlightening children about their rights and civic responsibilities[cite: 22].</p>

                <h3>Project Reach and Methodology</h3>
                [cite_start]<p>We have reached 350 children across 3 schools with the project[cite: 23]. [cite_start]We simulated real-life situations to illustrate how their participation in these crises demonstrates an infringement of these rights and the consequences that follow[cite: 23].</p>

[cite_start]Our work will further: Educate thousands of children about their rights, reduce child abuse and exploitation, improve education and civic engagement, and build a brighter future for Nigeria[cite: 26, 27].</p>
