                        [cite_start]<p>According to UNICEF data of 2022, **6 out of 10 children in Nigeria suffer from one form of violence or abuse**[cite: 2]. [cite_start]They suffer from abuse, exploitation, and violence[cite: 3].</p>
                        [cite_start]<p>Issues range from children being used in violence and war, to forced marriage, forced labor, bullying, and child rape—the issues are endless[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Others are denied basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare[cite: 4].</p>

                        [cite_start]<p>Without knowledge of their rights, Nigerian children can't protect themselves[cite: 5]. [cite_start]These are real problems that Nigerian children face every day[cite: 4].</p>
                        [cite_start]<p>We are of the firm belief that if the rights of children can be protected, we are giving them a great chance of having a brighter future and leading successful lives as adults[cite: 7].</p>
