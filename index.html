                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>According to UNICEF data of 2022, **6 out of 10 children in Nigeria suffer from one form of violence or abuse**. They suffer from abuse, exploitation, and violence.</p>
                        <p>Issues range from children being used in violence and war, to forced marriage, forced labor, bullying, and child rape—the issues are endless. Others are denied basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare.</p>

                        <h3>The Vulnerability</h3>
                        <p> The numbers make for scary reading-According to UNICEF data of 2022- 6 out of 10 children in Nigeria suffer from one form of violence or abuse. </p>
                        <p>They suffer from abuse, exploitation, and violence. From children being used as instruments of violence and war, to a young girl being forced into marriage, 
                            to those being forced to work instead of going to school, to a child being bullied in school, to child rape- the issues are endless. </p>
                        <p> Others are denied basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare. These are real problems that Nigerian children face every day. 
                            Without knowledge of their rights, they can't protect themselves.</p>
